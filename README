## Setup Instructions

Before using this script, you **must** change these variables inside the script file to your own Telegram credentials:

```powershell
$global:TG_CHAT_ID = "your-user-id"
$global:TG_API_TOKEN = "your-bots-api-key"
```

* Replace `$global:TG_CHAT_ID` with your **Telegram Chat ID**
* Replace `$global:TG_API_TOKEN` with your **Telegram Bot API Token**

### How to create a Telegram Bot and get these values:

1. Open Telegram and search for **BotFather**
2. Send `/newbot` and follow the prompts to create your bot
3. Copy the **API token** BotFather provides — use this as your `TG_API_TOKEN`
4. To get your chat ID, you can message your bot and check updates using a Telegram API tool or use bots like `@userinfobot`
